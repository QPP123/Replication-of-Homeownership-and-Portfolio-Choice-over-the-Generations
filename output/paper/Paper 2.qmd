# Abstract

This study examines declining rates of home ownership across
generations, focusing on changes in income risk and economic conditions
between the 1940s, 1960s and 1980s. By using a life-cycle model with
housing and portfolio choices that includes risks in earnings and asset
prices, we show that changes in earnings dynamics relate to a large part
of reductions of homeownership across generations. We found that changes
in income mobility contribute significantly to the decline in
homeownership rates. This trend particularly affects low-income
households, preventing them from buying a home and saving money. Our
findings highlight the significant impact of the financial status and
economic environment on the different generations’ home-ownership and
portfolio choices.

# Introduction

The landscape of American household ownership and financial stability
has changed dramatically in recent decades (1940s to 1960s to 1980s),
with rising income inequality and notable changes in savings choice at
birth series have been marked. By using a cyclical model of household
decisions in construction policy management under different economic
conditions, we examine the effects of labor market development and
financial market development on different groups. Our research reveals
significant differences in the number of households, particularly
affecting younger generations, which face greater income risk and
adverse financial market conditions. The core of our analysis focuses on
the hypothesis that changes in labor market earnings dynamics account
for a substantial proportion of the decline in inter-generational
homeownership. This study not only marks important gaps in understanding
the relationship between income risk, investment decisions, and
homeownership, but also sheds light on the broader implications of
wealth inequality and monetary policy also on the. Through this study,
we aim to provide insight into the mechanisms by which these changes are
brought about, and thus create policy interventions that can mitigate
adverse effects for future generations under the customs.

# An Overview of Intergerational Changes: Explained with Related

Literature Individuals born in the 1960s and 1980s experienced greater
income inequality, higher income volatility, and higher average housing
costs relative to the 1940s cohort has led to a decline in the number of
homeowners but there has been a rise in savings but the increased
participation of female workers has offset this trend somewhat,
maintaining or increasing the middle income a are obtained for younger
groups after 30 years. This reflects the rightward shift of the income
distribution, with higher earners seeing larger gains, as opposed to
stagnant or declining incomes at the lower end This change implies
economic differences will widen in new groups from an early age.
Moreover, younger groups face greater earnings volatility, attributed to
labor market changes that differentially affect working hours and
employment stability, suggesting subtle effects across labor force
groups.（De Nardi, 2004) All of these economic differences between
generations had caused inequality in savings and wealth accumulations in
households, leading directly to difference in homeownership rates and
differences in other investment behaviors such as stock market
participation. (De Nardi et al, 2017)

# Estimated

In this study, our paper replicates the population that was used in
“Homeownership and Portfolio Choice over the Generations” (Paz-Pardo
2023) which mentions that the population differs between different
datasets. According to the data retrieved from the paper, the
generations born in the 1960s and 1980s, when compared to that of the
1940s, have faced more earnings inequality, volatility, and on average
more expensive housing costs. Showing that these people are less likely
to become homeowners, but are more suited and likely to participate in
the stock market.

# Data Analysis

The article presents a comprehensive analysis of intergenerational
changes in homeownership, earnings inequality, and financial portfolio
choices, utilizing data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
and Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Figures 1 and 2 in the paper
illustrate key empirical findings:

Figure 1 depicts median and average household earnings by age and
cohort, alongside the standard deviation of earnings and changes in
earnings, showcasing the increased earnings inequality and volatility
across generations. It also illustrates trends in homeownership and
stock market participation rates, highlighting a decline in
homeownership and an increase in stock market participation among
younger cohorts.

Figure 2 focuses on the evolution of house prices and asset returns,
specifically the median Price to Income (PTI) ratios for housing and the
comparison between stock returns and Federal Housing Finance Agency
(FHFA) house price index growth. This figure underscores the growing
challenge of housing affordability and the cyclical nature of asset
returns, which have varied implications across different cohorts.

The paper thoroughly discusses the broader context of these datasets,
explaining the construction and cleaning of variables while emphasizing
the destination of the analysis rather than the methodological journey.
It acknowledges alternative datasets that could have been used but
justifies the chosen data sources based on their relevance and
comprehensiveness for the study's objectives. Summary statistics and
discussions on the relationship between variables provide insights into
the underlying trends and shifts in the economic landscape affecting
homeownership and portfolio choices across generations.

# Measurements

This paper replicates the life-cycle structural model that was created
to evaluate the changes in earning and financial conditions with
different age groups. This model evaluates the changes in earnings and
financial conditions described in each demographic and can account for
different intergenerational contrasts in homeownership and portfolios.
The life-cycle model shows that the economy is populated by a continuum
of households and the perspective of a cohort, and time is indexed in a
period of two years.The demographic measurements retrieved from the
paper shows that households born in the model at age 25, end up retiring
at the age of 60 and results in them facing positive and increasing
death probabilities starting at the age of 25. Concluding that people in
these demographics certainly die at the age of 86. An average
demographic profile at each age is introduced in the model with a taste
shifter, which represents the average OECD equivalence scale at each age
and generates age-varying marginal utility from nondurable housing
consumption.

# Results

In figure 1, people’s average and median household earnings, standard
deviation of earnings distribution and earnings change, proportion of
homeownership, and stock market participation are all presented in line
graphs.

According to our findings, in graph (a) and (b) of figure 1, for people
aged 25, people in the 1940s have the highest median household earrings
and average household earnings among the six decades (1940s, 1960s, and
1980s). The average and median household earnings for eople aged 25 in
the 1960s and 1980s were both less than those people in the 1940s.

For graph (c), people at all ages, people living in the 1940s had the
lowest standard deviation of earnings distribution, which implies that
during this period, there was less variability or disparity in the
amounts of money people earned.

Also, for graph (d), people aged 25 to 35, those who lived in the 1940s
had the lowest standard deviation of earnings earnings change, meaning
that the year-to-year fluctuations in income for individuals or
households during that period were relatively small. In other words, the
amount of money people earned from one year to the next tended to remain
more consistent, with less variability in earnings increases or
decreases, compared to later periods. This suggests a more stable
economic environment for earnings during the 1940s, with fewer dramatic
changes in individuals' financial situations from year to year. People
aged 25 to 35 who lived in the 1940s had the lowest possibility of
experiencing sudden significant loss or gain of income, same-age people
lived in the 1960s had a higher possibility, and same-age people lived
in the 1980s had the highest possibility.

For graph (e), in the 1940s the proportion of home owners is the highest
among the six decades (1940s, 1960s, 1980s). The proportion of
homeownership across all ages decreased from 1940s to 1960, meaning that
in the three decades more and more people were either not able to afford
homeownership or they rather not to be a home owner.

As for stock market participation, the graph (f) became more
interesting: people lived in the 1940s did not have much interest in
stock market at the age of 25, however their interests in stock market
significantly increase as they aged. People in the 1960s, on the other
hand, had greater interests in the stock market at 25 and their
interests continue to significantly increase, however, their interests
suddenly decrease at the age of around 40.

In figure 2, it is about the evolution of house prices and asset
returns. Graph (a) shows median Price to Income (PTI) ratios for housing
(PSID data). Graph (b) shows stock returns, S&P 500, vs. growth in
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index. Shaded areas
correspond to NBER recessions. It is obvious that the PTI ratios for
housing has been steadily increasing, while the stock growth change is
very unstable over the decades. This suggests that during the documented
time (1970s to 2010s), real estate is a safer long-term investment
choice for steady growth than stock markets.

# Discussion

1.  An interesting finding from both figure 1 and 2 is that although the
    younger generations (1960s generations in particular) had a greater
    risk of experiencing earnings changes, they still tended to put
    their money in the stock market, which is statistically proven to be
    more unstable and thus riskier than the housing market. In
    comparison, the 1940s generation were less likely to experience
    earnings change, and they were more likely to put their money in the
    real estate market (be homeowners), and less likely to participate
    in the stock market.

2.  Correlation: The information replicated from the paper shows that
    the graphs are successful in determining the replications of
    portfolio patterns by wealth, showing that a standard portfolio
    choice would yield stock holding patterns which are mildly
    decreasing rather than increasing it with wealth and profit. The
    role of housing and the correlation of labor income and stock
    returns end up reducing the incentive of the income-poorer to
    participate in the stock market. In contrast, with richer
    individuals who have sufficient resources available even after
    buying their homes and use these resources for investing purposes in
    the stock market, in which they yield a greater return that results
    in them being wealthier.

3.  Strengths: The paper that was replicated does a fantastic job of
    showing how the changes in earnings dynamics in different cohorts of
    demographics have affected homeownership portfolio choice decisions.
    By providing evidence that was retrieved from PSID and SCF data
    dating all the way back to the 1960s, the strengths of the data can
    determine that there has been a significant increase in household
    earnings inequality and risk. Which both

4.  Weaknesses: The paper’s findings suggest that intergenerational
    changes are important for studies of household incomes in terms of
    earnings, consumption, and wealth accumulation. In which, the paper
    tries to show that the distribution of the economy is formed by many
    different households who have lived through different events in the
    past that impacted their personal economic growth in different
    stages in their life. However, in terms of demographics, the paper
    retrieves a significant portion of the data and information from the
    older generation as the youngest household owner age in the paper is
    the age of 25. In the current generation, homeownership is becoming
    more common in North America beginning at the age of 18 which is the
    legal age to own a house in both Canada and the United States. As
    many young adults are becoming homeowners whether it would be
    through the finances of their family or purchasing a house by
    themselves when they move off to college or university in another
    part of their country, becoming a homeowner is becoming more
    relatively common as the new and current generations have access to
    resources that allow them to become homeowners at a young age. Which
    is something the paper could improve on in terms of expanding the
    age group of homeowners in the current generation.\*\*

# Conclusion

In conclusion, homeownership rate and portfolio choices varied
significantly between different generations in the 1940s, 1960s, and
1960s. We found that people in the 1940s were the generation that had
the least possibility of experiencing earnings change and they could own
their home at the earliest age, while people in the 1980s were the
generation that could experience the most earnings change and they were
the oldest ages when owning their homes. We also found that people in
the 1940s did not have much interest in the stock market - which is
statistically proven to be riskier than the housing market, while people
in the 1980s had a greater interest in stock markets before they were
40. It is safe to suggest that people in the 1940s were in a more steady
economic environment and thus they tend to be more conservative when it
comes to money and investment, while people in the 1980s were in a more
ever-changing environment and thus were more likely to become
risk-takers when they were younger.

Since housing is a necessity for all people, future monetary and housing
policies should be introduced so that more young generations could
afford to own their own houses at an earlier age. Since there are many
resources that can allow for anyone to learn more about housing and
stock market policies, it makes it much easier to become a homeowner at
a young age. Concluding our findings by replicating the paper which
shows that homeownership rate and portfolio choices vary in different
generations and shows growth and decline depending on the homeowners
income and economic situation at that time.
