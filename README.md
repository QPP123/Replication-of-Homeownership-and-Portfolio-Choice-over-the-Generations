- outputs/data contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
- outputs/paper contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
- Statement on LLM usage: ChatGPT-4 is used as a starting point when writing the abstract and introduction. However, we did not copy and paste it directly. We write it with our own words and thoughts.
